# ehwan

adopt a virtual succulent or kitty who you "feed" using your mobile camera on ehwan. 

ehwan ("pet") lets you take care of a cyber-being of your choice, and you have to satisfy its needs by sending its the right pixels. whenever it asks for food, warmth, or someone to take the loneliness away, you have to send it a picture through the cyberstream. 

your pet will recognize the images you send in words, and your bond will grow as you send it the right virtual material it needs to grow healthy and strong.
